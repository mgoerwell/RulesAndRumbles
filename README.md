# RulesAndRumbles
This project was created as a final project for graduation from BCIT.
It is a puzzle platformer centered around pressing switches to adjust various properties of the game world.
These properties include gravity, user movement, game perspective (2D vs 3D) and solid terrain.

While fairly basic in presentation (game objects are mainly flat polygons with textures), the game consists of 15 levels and has a decent level of complexity.
The levels, while fairly linear, do allow some options for optimization of gameplay, and in my own opinion provide an engaging experience.

Please find attached the basic manual for the game, and take the time to read it, as the game lacks an internal tutorial.
